## Overview
This code showcases a Java program that displays the current date and continuously updates the time in real-time. Using the DateTimeFormatter class, the program formats the date and time to the "MM:dd:yy" and "kk:mm:ss" patterns, respectively. The program enters an infinite loop, continuously printing the current time with a one-second interval. This code demonstrates the use of Java's java.time package to access and format date and time information, providing a basic foundation for incorporating real-time functionality into applications.
